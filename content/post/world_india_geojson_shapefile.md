It is surprisingly hard to find a world geojson that includes the borders claimed by India. I am releasing
a GeoJSON and a set of Shapefiles based on the high quality [Natural Earth countries shapefile](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-admin-0-countries/) that draws India
using the borders it claims.
