_We release a preliminary GeoJSON for the newly created Ladakh Union Territory. This resource is still being developed so no claims can be made about its accuracy._

There is a change in India's internal geography - two new union territories
are now added to the map. We put together this geojson quickly with 2 data
sources: (i) [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-admin-0-breakaway-disputed-areas/) for the polygons
of the Aksai Chin, and Demchok (ii) [Datameet's district maps](https://github.com/datameet/maps/tree/master/Districts) for Kargil and Leh. The territories don't quite fit together
and it is not clear if this is the correct geometry or composition at all but it is what we have at the moment. We'll update this
as soon as we get more information.
